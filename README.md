Weekly projects to apply what we learned during the week

In this repository I included each weekly workshop project that we worked on both independantly and as a group to apply the topics learned throughout the week.
Below is a short explanation for each project.

class1-profilePage - For this project we created a small and simple personal profile page.  I used sections, lists and headers to display information about myself. 
I added an audio element with controls, images and hyperlinks to my social media using anchor elements.  I also added section IDs to help the user navigate easily around
the page.
class1Tests -  This file is a work in progress for me to further my HTML, CSS and JS skills on my own time.  My idea is to create a much more in depth, user friendly profile page
to help me learn more and continue to apply what I learned in this course.

class2-datingPage - For the project we created a website to register a dating profile. We used HTML to create the page structure and content, internal CSS to add visual styles to
the page and also added a few interactive features.  We created a form element to post the info to a site. I created a fieldset using a div element for the user to upload a image.
I created a second fieldset for the users details using text inputs, radio/checkbox inputs, date inputs, color inputs, a select drop down menu and a range bar. And the third 
fieldset for the users contact information reusing the previous inputs as well as a submit button.  I then added color and spacing through internal stylesheets and a hover pseudoclass on all div elements to show the text in blue when highlighting a section.

colorMatchGame - For this assignment we created a color guessing game.  The assignment called for a single HTML file with the JS inside the script element, rather than using
an external JS file which is best practice.  For this project we used an arrays, functions, loops, and alerts/promps to have the user guess a color and check that guess with the
randomly generated color.  The target color is given to start the game for testing purposes(line 24) and can be commented out if neccessary.

smileGame  - For this assignment we created a matching game with smiley faces. The left side will always have one extra face, the user must click the extra face. If anything  except the correct face is clicked a message is displayed saying the game is over. If the correct face is clicked, a new and larger set of faces is shown at random positions. 
We used divs, internal style sheets and functions with internal JS. We also used DOM manipulation to grab information as well as edit the DOMs nodes.
